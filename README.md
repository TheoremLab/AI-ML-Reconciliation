This project aims to automate the financial account reconciliation process using a combination of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and deterministic rule-based logic. By streamlining the reconciliation workflow, the solution enhances operational efficiency, minimizes manual errors, and provides intelligent insights through anomaly detection and predictive matching.

The system ingests transactional data from various source systems (ERP, CRM, GL), validates it, and processes it through a two-tiered reconciliation engineâ€”first applying business rules, then leveraging a machine learning model trained to predict match likelihood. A user-friendly dashboard supports interactive review, manual overrides, audit trails, and continuous feedback to improve model performance over time.

Tools Used for Development Work: 
    Python: Backend development, ML models, and frontend development(React/Streamlit). 
    Pandas: For data uploading, data cleansing, validation layers, and reconciliation pre-processing. 
    Snowflake: Tables of recordkeeping which has daily updates. Some examples can be account balances or loans. Other objective of this tool is to
    store and track error logs into a table. 
    Scikit-Learn: Used for supervised learning and other ML features such as amount_delta, date_delta and textual similarities.
